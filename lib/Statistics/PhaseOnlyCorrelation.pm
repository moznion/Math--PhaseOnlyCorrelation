=head1 NAME

Statistics::PhaseOnlyCorrelation - calculate the phase only correlation


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Statistics::PhaseOnlyCorrelation version 0.0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Statistics::PhaseOnlyCorrelation qw/poc/;

    my $array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
    my $array2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];

    my $coeff = poc($array1, $array2);

Or if you want to use own FFT function, you may use like so:

    my $result = Statistics::PhaseOnlyCorrelation::poc_without_fft($array1_fft->cdft(), $array2_fft->cdft());
    use Math::FFT;
    use List::MoreUtils qw/mesh/;
    use Statistics::PhaseOnlyCorrelation qw/poc_without_fft/;

    my @array1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8);
    my @array2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8);
    my @zero_array = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0); # <= imaginary components

    @array1 = mesh(@array1, @zero_array);
    @array2 = mesh(@array2, @zero_array);

    my $array1_fft = Math::FFT->new(\@array1);
    my $array2_fft = Math::FFT->new(\@array2);
    my $result = poc_without_fft($array1_fft->cdft(), $array2_fft->cdft());

    my $ifft = Math::FFT->new($result);
    my $coeff = $ifft->invcdft($result);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

    This module calculate Phase Only Correlation coefficients. This measures degree of similarity between two waves (signals) heed to only phase component,
    so this method is not affected by an amplitude difference.

    The more similar two signals (waves), coefficient will approximates 1.0. In the opposite case, coefficient will approaches zero.



=head1 METHODS

=over

=item poc

Calculate phase only correlation with FFT (This function is using Math::FFT).

This function needs two arguments. Both of arguments are array reference. Array reference just has real part (don't need imaginary part).

=item poc_without_fft

Calculate phase only correlation without FFT.

This function needs two arguments. Both of arguments are array reference, these reference must be processed by FFT.

=back


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
